<h2>Transportation</h2>
<img src="..\les\images\bus.jpg"  style="width:35%;height:40%;">
<p>The Transport facility currently includes 12 buses that are equipped with a Vehicle Tracking System (VTS) and on board cameras. 
This allows the School to monitor speed and location of the route. This effectively ensures the safety and security of scholars on board.
Each bus is air-conditioned and is manned by a security guard and care giver who pick and drop children safely from their designated bus 
stops to school and back. Parents/Guardians are expected to carry the Escort Card at all times during the Pick-up and drop.</p>
