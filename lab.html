<h2>Science Lab</h2>
<p>To meet the requirements of our Senior Middle, Secondary and Senior Secondary students,
state-of-the-art labs (for General Science, Math, Physics, Chemistry and Biology) are provided 
with excellent equipment and facilities , ensuring safe learning experience in a spacious and 
distinct setup, in concurrence with the CBSE norms.</p>

<p>A STEAM lab is also designed to ensure student success through a combination of text, 
videos, ICT and real-world, hands-on activities. As against the traditional teacher-centric 
classroom model, children learn by way of enquiry, exploration, questioning, debate, application, 
collaboration, challenge</p>
